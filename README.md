flickr-titan
============

Straightforward script to batch search-and-replace text in photos' titles and descriptions on Flickr. Photos are
selected by set ID.

Edit flickr-titan.py and replace the ALL_CAPS variables with the relevant values for your account.

Runs from command line, suggested Python 2.7.x or later. Requires python-flickrapi and ElementTree (latter is included
in recent Python releases).
